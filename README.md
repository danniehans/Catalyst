Morpheus Labs Hackathon 2022

Mission: Enable philanthropic organizations to have a secure, engaged and localized donor community.

Vision: A world where everyone engages actively with a philanthropic organization.


## Proof of concept
We are using blockchain to provide an automated and visible process for donors to support philanthropic organizations. Through the issuance of NFT which has utilities beyond just owning it for example - using it for discounts on partnering organizations, retail donors would be more encouraged to participate and donate to philanthropic organizations. 

## Future roadmap
We plan to provide a smart contract between philanthropic organizations and the country's government in which there is visibility and promise on how the money that was raised is going to be spent. Moreover, we can provide timely updates to donors on the outcome of the spending. Governments too can further encourage their citizens to participate in donation by promising tax rebates. Such developments would enable more funds to be raised and enable more philanthropic organizations to realise their mission.
